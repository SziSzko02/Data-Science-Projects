# Data-Science-Projects
Hello everyone, 
Here are a few words about me:
My name is Szilard and I am very excited to start this new challange in my life. Data science is a very interesting career,
where I belive every project is a new challange, a new way to learn and adding more and more knowledge to my skills.
My goal is to become a professional data scientist and with time be able to bring something new, something useful and helpful
to this field.
I will add all my project to this repository and all will be public.
I hope, I can show proficiency and who will see my work will like it.
Every feedbacks are welcome bad or good doesn't matter all are welcome ( maybe bad is better in leraning wise :) )
